#+title: Ï€-lab

My homelab

* Usage
With =stow= and =podman= setup, run
#+begin_src shell
  stow --target=$HOME .
  systemctl --user daemon-reload
#+end_src
and then individually enable services.
* Description
See [[.config/systemd/user/README.org][this]].
** What this is
A bunch of systemd =.service= files that symlink to =$HOME.=
** What this is not
- Docker compose or swarm
- Fancy k8s or k3s cluster
- Ansible or chef playbooks
- Terraform
- Declaratively defined Nix, Guix, or CoreOS definition


This is not to discredit any of these tools nor does it mean that I
don't use them in other places; it just seemed to me that systemd user
services with podman get my job done without any hassle on a raspberry
pi 4.
