#+title: Ï€-lab

My humble homelab hosted on a Raspberry pi 4

* Usage
With [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]] and [[https://podman.io/][podman]] installed, run this:
#+begin_src shell :results none
  stow --target=$HOME .           # Symlink
  systemctl --user daemon-reload  # Reload user services
#+end_src


and then individually enable services.
* Description
See [[.config/systemd/user/README.org][this]]
** What this is
A bunch of systemd =.service= files that symlink to =$HOME=.
** What this is not
- Docker compose or swarm
- Fancy k8s or k3s cluster
- Ansible or chef playbooks
- Terraform
- Declaratively defined Nix, Guix, or CoreOS definition


This is not to discredit any of these tools nor does it mean that I
don't use them in other places; it just seemed to me that systemd user
services with podman get my job done without any hassle on a raspberry
pi 4.
